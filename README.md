# Finite Element Methods for Geotechnical Consolidation (Pore Pressure & Settlement)

## Overview
This repository explores numerical methods for geotechnical consolidation, focusing on:
- **Terzaghi 1D consolidation** (diffusion PDE for excess pore pressure)
- **Biot consolidation** (coupled displacement–pore pressure system, planned)

The goal is to build **verified, reproducible implementations** that can be extended to:
layered soils, spatially varying parameters, and eventually coupled consolidation.
