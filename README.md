Project Purpose and Descriptions

Dolfinx
A Docker based FEniCSx environment prepared for developing and testing finite-element PDE solvers has been created. this potentially will change into a virtual machine to use instead to prevent any potential clashing. However a docker file has been incorporated.

.src - Are my written code from myself (via the bad coding and weird style seen)
